### What I learned

-   I took in [feedback](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/ping-coming-soon-page-using-html-css-and-javascript-validation-dpQyuqG8p) from [@pikamart](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/pikamart) and used visibilty attribute to show errors, Thank You once again.
-   Mobile First Design Priciples
-   Using rem and % instead of pixels to define sizes

### Continued development

I want to write CSS in SASS or tailwind into this webpage and in future convert it to React SPA. Further would like to use email validation library like validate.js to validate email addresses so I don't miss out on boundary conditions.
